A [ShokoServer](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer) plugin that scans your anime collection for missing episodes and bridges them to [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) for automated download — with a related-series discovery feed and a [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) bolt-on for movie-type suggestions.

## ELI5

Shoko tracks what anime episodes you already have. Sonarr downloads episodes for you. This plugin sits between them: it scans your Shoko library for episodes you're missing, matches each series to the right one in Sonarr, and tells Sonarr "go find these specific episodes" — no manual searching, no adding whole seasons you already have. It also surfaces AniDB-related series you don't own at all yet (sequels, prequels, side stories) as one-click suggestions, routed to Sonarr or Radarr depending on whether the suggestion is a series or a movie.

## What it does

- **Scans** every already-inventoried Shoko series (on-demand from the dashboard, or on a configurable schedule) for episodes with no local file.
- **Matches** each series to Sonarr via its TMDB-linked TVDB ID, falling back to a confirmable title search when no TVDB link exists yet — the same confirmation flow is available directly on any series with no auto-resolved match.
- **Bridges the gap**: adds the series to Sonarr if it isn't there yet (without triggering a full-series download), then triggers a targeted `EpisodeSearch` for just the missing episodes.
- **Reconciles automatically**: once Shoko confirms an episode was actually imported, the plugin unmonitors it in Sonarr so Sonarr's own RSS/automatic search stops re-fetching something you already have. A stale pending search that keeps failing (e.g. the Sonarr episode was deleted out-of-band) is dropped after 14 days instead of retrying forever.
- **Filters out noise**: optionally exclude specials (globally or per-series), and optionally hide episodes that haven't aired yet — since there's nothing for Sonarr to find until the air date passes.
- **Suggests what you're missing entirely**: surfaces AniDB-related series (sequels, prequels, side stories) you own zero episodes of, from series you already have. Movie-type suggestions route to Radarr; everything else routes to Sonarr, both via a confirmable title search.
- **Propagates Shoko's group metadata as a Sonarr tag** on add, so Sonarr-side automation can key off which franchise a series belongs to. A manual "Sync Tags" action retroactively tags series added before this existed.
- **Lets a series override the global quality profile/root folder** — useful for a group that should land somewhere different than everything else.
- **Bulk actions** — multi-select series to apply a specials override or trigger Add-to-Sonarr/Search across all of them at once.
- **Notifies** an optional Discord-compatible webhook when a search is triggered, a movie/series discovery is added, or a stale pending entry expires.
- **Shows Sonarr's live reachability** in the dashboard header at a glance, instead of only after clicking Test Connection.

## What it's not

The core missing-episode scan only covers series Shoko already has *some* files for — it doesn't manage Sonarr's quality/upgrade settings (bring your own quality profile), and it doesn't scan owned series for "missing Radarr movies" (Radarr only comes into play for unowned movie-type suggestions, since Shoko has no TMDB movie link data for anything it doesn't already own).

## Dashboard

Single-pane-of-glass UI embedded in Shoko's WebUI. Open it from Shoko's plugin pages list, or go directly to:

```
http://<your-shoko-host>:<port>/api/plugin/ShokoSonarr/dashboard
```

- **Connection health** — a persistent Sonarr-reachable/unreachable indicator in the header, refreshed every 60s.
- **Series list** — every series with missing episodes, expandable to see each episode and its status (`none` / `search-triggered`). Multi-select checkboxes drive the bulk-actions bar (specials override, Add to Sonarr/Search) across several series at once.
- **Specials toggle** — per-series Include/Exclude override for specials episodes; click the active button again to clear it back to the global default.
- **Profile override** — per-series Sonarr quality-profile/root-folder override, independent of the specials toggle.
- **Find Match** — for any series without an auto-resolved TVDB ID, search and confirm a Sonarr match directly from its row.
- **Suggestions** — AniDB-related series you own nothing of, with an Add to Sonarr or Add to Radarr action depending on type.
- **Sync Tags** — retroactively pushes the Shoko-group tag onto Sonarr series added before tag propagation existed.
- **Pending Searches** — view and cancel any in-flight Sonarr search the plugin has triggered but Shoko hasn't confirmed as imported yet.
- **History** — a log of past outcomes (triggered, imported, cancelled, expired) for episodes that were previously pending, since Pending Searches only shows what's still in-flight.
- **Theme picker** — System (follows OS dark/light), Ember, Deep Teal, AniBlackle, or Paper.
- **Settings** — separate Sonarr and Radarr connection sections (base URL/API key/quality profile/root folder each), scan interval, include-specials, hide-unaired, and an optional Discord-compatible notification webhook.

### First-time setup

1. Open Settings, enter your Sonarr base URL and API key (Sonarr → Settings → General).
2. Click **Test Connection** to populate the Quality Profile and Root Folder dropdowns.
3. Pick a profile and folder, then **Save**.
4. Optionally repeat steps 1–3 in the Radarr Connection section if you want movie-type suggestions routed there.

> Sonarr/Radarr must be directly reachable from the Shoko host. If either sits behind a reverse proxy with SSO/forward-auth, use its internal LAN address instead — API-key requests can't pass through an SSO login redirect.

## Installing

### Via Shoko's plugin manager (recommended)

This repo publishes a live [`manifest.json`](manifest.json) that ShokoServer's plugin manager can consume directly as a repository. It's kept up to date automatically: every tagged GitHub release adds its own entry (version, changelog, per-runtime archive + checksum) via CI.

1. In Shoko's WebUI, go to **Settings → Plugins** and add a new repository with:
   - **Name:** `Shoko Sonarr` (or anything you like)
   - **URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foowy/shoko_sonarr/master/manifest.json`
2. Shoko fetches the manifest and lists Shoko Sonarr as an installable package — pick a release and install it from there.
3. Once installed, enable **auto-upgrade** on the repository/package if you want future releases pulled in automatically; otherwise re-check the plugin manager after new releases.

### Manual deploy

```bash
dotnet publish ShokoSonarr -c Release -o <output-dir>
# copy <output-dir>/* into Shoko's plugins/ShokoSonarr/ directory, then restart Shoko Server
```

Plugin load only happens at ShokoServer startup — copying the DLL alone has no effect.

## Building & testing

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test -c Release
```

83 tests cover missing-episode scanning (specials filtering, hidden/credits-type exclusion, unaired filtering, group/override propagation), Sonarr and Radarr search/reconciliation (success, failure, expiry, exception paths), the Sonarr and Radarr HTTP clients, series/movie matching, related-series discovery, notifications, and LiteDB settings persistence (including backward-compatible deserialization of pre-upgrade settings docs and cross-field override preservation).
